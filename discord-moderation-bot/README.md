# discord-moderation-bot/README.md (Markdown)

Based on the project description and tech stack provided below:

Project Overview:

- A discord moderation bot will be developed to assist in managing a discord server efficiently.
- The bot will help in maintaining order, enforcing rules, and ensuring a positive user experience.

Features:

- Automatic moderation for profanity, spam, and inappropriate content.
- Customizable warning system for users who violate server rules.
- Ability to kick or ban users based on specified criteria.
- Integration with user roles to assign permissions for certain commands.
- Logging of moderation actions for transparency and accountability.
- Scheduled automated messages for server announcements or reminders.
- Command customization for server-specific needs.
- Ability to set up reaction roles for users to self-assign roles.
- Support for multiple languages for a diverse user base.

Enhancements:

- Implement a machine learning algorithm to improve profanity detection accuracy.
- Integrate with a database for storing user data and moderation history.
- Develop a user-friendly dashboard for server administrators to manage bot settings and view logs.
- Create a voting system for users to participate in decision-making processes within the server.
- Include a feature for users to report inappropriate behavior directly to moderators for quick action.

Programming Languages:

- Python will be used for developing the Discord moderation bot due to its simplicity, readability, and strong community support.

APIs:

- Discord API will be integrated to interact with the Discord server, manage messages, users, and roles efficiently.

Packages and Libraries:

- discord.py (latest version) will be utilized to create the bot, handle events, commands, and interactions with the Discord API.
- scikit-learn (latest version) will be used for implementing the machine learning algorithm to enhance profanity detection accuracy.
- SQLite3 (latest version) will be employed for integrating a database to store user data and moderation history.
- Flask (latest version) will be utilized to develop a user-friendly dashboard for server administrators.
- Google Cloud Translate API will be integrated to support multiple languages for a diverse user base.

Rationale:

- Python is chosen for its ease of use and extensive libraries, making development faster and more efficient.
- discord.py is the preferred choice as it is a well-documented library with active development, ensuring compatibility with future Discord updates.
- scikit-learn is a popular choice for machine learning tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in classification problems like profanity detection.
- SQLite3 is lightweight and easy to set up, making it suitable for storing user data and moderation history.
- Flask is chosen for the dashboard development due to its simplicity, flexibility, and compatibility with Python.
- Google Cloud Translate API is selected to provide language support, catering to the diverse user base of the Discord server.

By leveraging these technical choices, the Discord moderation bot will be equipped with robust features and enhancements to streamline server management effectively.
